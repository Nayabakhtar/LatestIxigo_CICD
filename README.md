Ixigo Automation Framework
This is a hybrid test automation framework for Ixigo built using Selenium with Java, Cucumber BDD, JUnit, and Allure reporting. The framework is designed to automate the flight booking test cases and ensure high-quality software delivery.



Explanation of the Project Structure
src/: Contains the main code for the framework as well as the test scripts.


src/main/java/:


pages/: This directory contains the Page Object Model (POM) classes. Each page of the application has a corresponding class here with methods to interact with the web elements on the page.


FlightResultsPage.java: Contains the logic for interacting with the flight search results page. This class includes methods for handling web elements and actions on the page.


HomePage.java: Represents the homepage of the flight booking application, including methods to select cities, dates, and initiate the search.


ReviewPage.java: Contains methods to interact with the booking review page, including validations and checking prices.


utils/: This directory contains utility classes that are shared across the framework.


DriverFactory.java: This class is responsible for managing the WebDriver instance. It implements the Browser Factory Pattern and handles browser initialization, configuration, and cleanup.


src/test/: Contains the test code and feature files.


src/test/java/:


runners/: This directory contains the Cucumber Test Runner class that integrates the feature files with step definitions.


TestRunner.java: This is the entry point for the Cucumber tests, setting up the configuration and linking it with the feature files.


stepDefinitions/: This directory contains the glue code for Cucumber. It maps the Gherkin steps defined in the feature files to Java methods.


StepDefinitions.java: Contains the step definition methods that are used to define the actions for each step in the feature files.


src/test/resources/:


Feature/: This directory contains the Gherkin feature files that describe the test scenarios in a human-readable format.


Ixigo_Flight_Booking.feature: A sample feature file containing the test scenarios for booking a flight on the Ixigo website.


allure.properties: This file contains the configuration settings for generating customized Allure reports.


target/: The target directory holds the output of the test executions.


allure-results/: Contains the results of test execution in the format expected by Allure, which is later used to generate detailed test reports.


cucumber-reports/: Stores the HTML reports generated by Cucumber (if enabled), showing detailed execution steps for each test.


screenshots/: Contains screenshots taken during the test execution when a test fails or at specific verification points.


Hybrid Framework
This framework is a hybrid framework, combining the strengths of several methodologies:
Page Object Model (POM): For modular and maintainable test design.


Cucumber BDD: For behavior-driven development, enabling non-technical stakeholders to understand test scenarios.


JUnit: For running tests and providing assertions.


Allure Reporting: For generating customizable, rich test reports that give clear insights into test execution and failures.


This structure allows the framework to be scalable, maintainable, and extensible, making it easier to add new test cases, manage test data, and report results.
